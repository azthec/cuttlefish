# Cuttlefish

A Java based [Ceph](https://ceph.com/) implementation.

> > "Ceph aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level, and freely available.
> > Ceph replicates data and makes it fault-tolerant, using commodity hardware and requiring no specific hardware support. As a result of its design, the system is both self-healing and self-managing, aiming to minimize administration time and other costs."

Currently very WIP.
